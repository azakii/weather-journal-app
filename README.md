# Weather-Journal App Project

## Weather Journal App
created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## How it Works?
after you download the files open the termenal using CMD `node server.js` 

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
